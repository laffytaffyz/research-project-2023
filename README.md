# K-band Absolute Magnitude Relations of Red Clump Stars Separated by Age
## Tiffany Zhang

### Abstract
Red clump (RC) stars are a distance indicator that clumps on the color-magnitude diagram on the basis of consistent magnitude. Consequently, many studies estimate magnitude by assuming a constant magnitude across the RC since the I-band (700 nm - 900 nm) magnitude (MI) lacks variation with metallicity and age in empirical data. However, theoretical models found variation in MI attributed to systematic trends with metallicity and age, suggesting calibrating a magnitude function of other physical characteristics instead. Studies attributed these discrepancies to population effects and recommend near-infrared passbands, including the K-band (2000 nm - 2400 nm), for their low frequency to minimize population effects. Past studies analyzed relations between the K-band magnitude (MK), color, metallicity, and age, including one stratified by age, so this study investigates relations between these parameters stratified by age to clarify trends from past studies, discover new trends, and compare them to similar relations in the I-band. After isolating cluster RC data from Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and Gaia-ESO DR5, MK exhibits insignificant correlation in all relations (p<0.05) but the greatest dependence on metallicity in old RC and the least root mean square error (RMS). Analyzing the I-band data from Pietrzyński et al. (2010), the significant correlation between MI and metallicity for all RC and young RC (p>0.05), the latter exhibiting the greatest dependence (R2 = 0.804), suggests weaker population effects in the I-band than previously believed. Estimated versus accepted magnitude plots—and the lower RMS of the K-band relation than the mean MK for old RC—suggest these three relations yield more accurate predictions than the mean magnitude. Furthermore, averaging distance predictions from the two passbands helped decrease the RMS. Thus, studies cannot solely rely on the mean MK or MI to estimate distance, but the appropriate method would depend on the age and passband.
